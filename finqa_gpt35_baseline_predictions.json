    "answer": "To find the estimated percentage of the revolving credit facility in relation to the total senior credit facility in millions, we need to first identify the amounts related to the revolving credit facility and the total senior credit facility.\n\nFrom the text, we know that the senior credit facility includes a $420.5 million term loan and a $945.5 million revolving credit facility. Therefore, the total senior credit facility amount is $420.5 million + $945.5 million = $1,366 million.\n\nNext, we need to identify the amount related to the revolving credit facility. The text states that a new $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility was entered into effective January 11, 2011. Therefore, the amount related to the revolving credit facility is $1,000 million.\n\nNow, we can calculate the estimated percentage of the revolving credit facility in relation to the total senior credit facility:\n\nPercentage = (Revolving credit facility amount / Total senior credit facility amount) * 100\nPercentage = ($1,000 million / $1,366 million) * 100\nPercentage \u2248 73.27%\n\nTherefore, the estimated percentage of the revolving credit facility in relation to the total senior credit facility is approximately 73.27%."

    "answer": "To find the interest rate on the redeemed 6.25% notes in 2004, we need to look at the information provided in the text and table.\n\n1. The text mentions that the 6.25% notes were redeemed at 102.083% of the principal amount plus unpaid and accrued interest.\n\n2. The total aggregate redemption price for the 6.25% notes was $221.9 million, including $4.8 million in accrued interest.\n\n3. The principal amount of the 6.25% notes that were redeemed was $212.7 million.\n\n4. The formula to calculate the interest rate on the redeemed notes is:\nInterest Rate = (Total Redemption Price - Principal Amount) / Principal Amount\n\n5. Let's calculate the interest rate on the redeemed 6.25% notes in 2004:\nInterest Rate = ($221.9 million - $212.7 million) / $212.7 million\nInterest Rate = $9.2 million / $212.7 million\nInterest Rate \u2248 0.0432\n\nTherefore, the interest rate on the redeemed 6.25% notes in 2004 was approximately 4.32%."

    "answer": "To calculate the growth rate in rental expense included in other operations and maintenance expense in 2002 compared to 2001, we need to find the percentage change in rental expenses between the two years.\n\n1. Calculate the rental expenses in 2001 and 2002:\n- Rental expense in 2001 = $75 million\n- Rental expense in 2002 = $84 million\n\n2. Find the difference between rental expenses in 2002 and 2001:\n$84 million - $75 million = $9 million\n\n3. Calculate the percentage change:\nPercentage Change = (Rental Expense in 2002 - Rental Expense in 2001) / Rental Expense in 2001 * 100%\nPercentage Change = ($9 million / $75 million) * 100%\nPercentage Change = 12%\n\nTherefore, the growth rate in rental expense included in other operations and maintenance expense in 2002 compared to 2001 is 12%."
