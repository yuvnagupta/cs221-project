(This information is not directly given in the table, but it's mentioned in the text.)\n- The text does not provide information about the balance from the money pool as of December 31, 2008.\n\nTo find the impact of the money pool balance on cash flow, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. The text mentions that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued securities and used the proceeds to pay off maturing debt and for other general corporate purposes. It also mentions that the portion of the debt that had been assumed by Entergy Texas was paid off by them.

Calculate the difference between the values:\n   Difference = 31 (billions) - 24 (billions) = 7 billions\n\n3. Find the percent change by dividing the difference by the value in the base year (2008) and then multiplying by 100:\n   Percent Change = [(Difference / Collateral Pool Values (2008)] * 100%\n\n4.

We can do this by subtracting the beginning balance from the ending balance:\n\nIncrease in balance = Ending balance - Beginning balance\n\nFrom the text, we know that the beginning balance was $53 million and the ending balance was $70 million. So:\n\nIncrease in balance = $70 million - $53 million = $17 million\n\nNow we need to find the percentual increase. To do this, we divide the increase in balance by the beginning balance and multiply by 100%:\n\nPercentual increase = (Increase in balance / Beginning balance) * 100%\n\nPercentual increase = ($17 million / $53 million) * 100%\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, we can also use a financial calculator or spreadsheet software.

The text states that this period is 2.5 years.\n\nTo find the average unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock per year, we can divide the total unrecognized compensation cost by the weighted average period.\n\nAverage unrecognized compensation cost per year = Total unrecognized compensation cost / Weighted average period\n\nAverage unrecognized compensation cost per year = $33.5 million / 2.5 years\n\nAverage unrecognized compensation cost per year = $13.4 million per year.\n\nTherefore, the average unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock per year is $13.4 million."

    "answer": "rst, we need to find out how much of the ATI 7.25% (7.25%) notes were repurchased during 2006. The text states that the company repurchased $74.9 million principal amount of these notes for $77.3 million in cash.\n\nSo, the amount paid above the carrying value to retire the notes was $77.3 million - $325.1 million (the carrying value as of December 31, 2005) = $44.8 million.\n\nThe text also states that there was a charge of $3.9 million related to amounts paid in excess of carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. This means that only $40.9 million ($74.9 million - $33.9 million) of the ATI 7.25% (7.25%) notes were actually retired with cash during 2006.\n\nTherefore, the portion of the ATI 7.25% (7.25%) notes that was paid off during 2006 was $40.9 million."

Therefore, we can calculate the pretax goodwill impairment charge by dividing the after-tax charge by (1 minus the tax rate).\n\nStep 1: Find the tax rate\nThe text does not provide the tax rate directly, but it does mention that the tax rate was 25% for the goodwill impairment charge.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the pretax goodwill impairment charge\nPretax goodwill impairment charge = After-tax goodwill impairment charge / (1 - Tax rate)\n= $8.7 billion / (1 - 0.25)\n= $11.68 billion\n\nTherefore, the tax rate applied to the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 was 25%."

The text mentions unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating income during 2012, but it does not specify the currency. However, the table provides information about the impact of foreign currency on revenues, and we know that the international operations' revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency. Therefore, it is unlikely that the operating expense in question is affected by the currencies listed in the table.\n\nHowever, the text mentions that there was unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating income of approximately $ 9.0 million in 2012. We can assume that this impact is due to the stronger U.S. dollar since the text also mentions that the company has a foreign exchange risk management policy and enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure to intercompany loans. Thus, the foreign currency in question is the U.S. dollar.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is the unfavorable impact on operating expense in 2012 resulting from a stronger U.S. dollar is $ 9.0 million."

Therefore, the anticipated increase in the number of berths in the global cruise fleet during this period is 173000.\n\nTo find the anticipated percentage increase, we need to calculate the percentage of the current number of berths that the new berths represent. The text states that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 503000 berths at the end of 2016.\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the global cruise fleet berths from 2017 to 2021 is:\n\n(173000 / 503000) x 100% = 34.42% (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the anticipated percentage increase in the global cruise fleet berths from 2017 to 2021 is approximately 34.42%."

    "answer": "rst, we need to find the amount of total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable leases and purchase obligations associated with purchase obligations in 2007.\n\nFrom the text, we know that there are $1.3 billion of purchase obligations related to discontinued operations and businesses held for sale. However, we need to find the amount that is due in the year 2007.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the total purchase obligations in 2007 were $2329 million. We need to find out how much of that total was related to the discontinued operations and businesses held for sale.\n\nTo do that, we need to find the difference between the total purchase obligations in 2007 and the lease obligations in 2007. In the text, we are told that lease obligations in 2007 were $144 million, so we can subtract that from the total purchase obligations in 2007.\n\n$2329 million (total purchase obligations in 2007) - $144 million (lease obligations in 2007) = $2185 million"

    "answer": "find the portion of total smokeless products shipments that are related to the Copenhagen segment during 2014, we need to find the shipment volume for Copenhagen and divide it by the total shipment volume for smokeless products.\n\nFrom the text, we know that the shipment volume for Copenhagen was 448.6 million during 2014.\n\nFrom the table provided, we can see that the total shipment volume for smokeless products was 793.3 million during 2014.\n\nTherefore, the portion of total smokeless products shipments related to the Copenhagen segment during 2014 can be calculated as follows:\n\n(shipment volume for Copenhagen) / (total shipment volume for smokeless products)\n=(448.6 million) / (793.3 million)\n\u22480.5726 or 57.26%\n\nSo, approximately 57.26% of the total smokeless products shipments during 2014 were related to the Copenhagen segment."

    "answer": "rst, we need to find the amount of net deferred tax liability for federal and foreign taxes from the given text. We know that as of December 31, 2015, Comcast had a net deferred tax liability of $23 billion, with $23 billion being related to cable franchise rights that are not going to change. So, the net deferred tax liability for taxes other than cable franchise rights is the total net deferred tax liability minus the amount related to cable franchise rights.\n\nNet deferred tax liability for taxes other than cable franchise rights = $23 billion - $23 billion = $0\n\nFrom the text, we also know that Comcast had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $135 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $700 million. So, the net deferred tax liability for federal taxes is the product of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and the tax rate for federal taxes.\n\nNet deferred tax liability for federal taxes = $135 million x tax rate for federal taxes\n\nLikewise, the net deferred tax liability for foreign taxes is the product of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the tax"
