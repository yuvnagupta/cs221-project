Let's denote this as 'C'. \n\nNext, we need to figure out the fair value of total securities available for sale. This can be found by adding the fair value of corporate stocks and the fair value of other securities available for sale. We are not given the fair value of other securities available for sale, so we'll assume it to be 'O'. Thus, the fair value of total securities available for sale would be C + O.\n\nNow, we need to find 'O'. We can do this by subtracting the fair value of corporate stocks from the total securities available for sale, which gives us O. So, O = C + O - C. Simplifying this, we get O = O.\n\nThis means that the fair value of other securities available for sale is the same as the fair value of corporate stocks. Since we know that the fair value of corporate stocks was $ 367 million, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the fair value of total securities available for sale.\n\nSo, the fair value of total securities available for sale"

    "answer": "d 2012. We know that in 2011, there were 1415 million dollars worth of residential mortgages and in 2012, there were 2220 million dollars worth of residential mortgages.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the difference between the two totals. To do this, we subtract the 2011 total from the 2012 total:\n\n2220 - 1415 = 705\n\nSo, the total increase in residential mortgages from 2011 to 2012 is 705 million dollars.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the percentage increase. To do this, we divide the increase by the initial total and multiply by 100:\n\n(705 / 1415) * 100 = 50%\n\nSo, the total residential mortgages increased by 50% from 2011 to 2012.\n\nAnswer: The total residential mortgages increased by 50% from 2011 to 2012."

We do this by subtracting the net acreage expiring in the year before from the net acreage expiring in the year after.\nFor example, in 2014, the net acreage expiring is 145 (from the U.S) + 60 (from Africa) + 2014 (from Europe) + 2014 (from International) + 2014 (from Worldwide) = 587,000 acres.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total net acreage expiring in the three year period. This is done by adding up the net acreage expiring in each year.\nTotal net acreage expiring = 587,000 (2014) + 3057 (2015) + 236 (2016) = 6,769,000 acres.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the average net acreage expiring in the three year period. This is done by dividing the total net acreage expiring by the number of years in the period.\nAverage net acreage expiring = 6,769,000 / 3 = 2,241,666 acres.\n\nSo, the average worldwide net acreage expiring in the total three year period"

From the problem, we can see that the company's cash obligations in 2004 are $73684 and in 2005 are $109435.\n\nTo find the percentage change, we can use the formula for percentage change: (new value - old value) / old value * 100. In this case, the new value is $109435 and the old value is $73684.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula: (109435 - 73684) / 73684 * 100 = (310919) / 73684 * 100 = 42.78%.\n\nTherefore, the expected percentage change in aggregate principal payments of long-term debt from 2004 to 2005 is approximately 42.78%.\n\nAnswer: The expected percentage change in aggregate principal payments of long-term debt from 2004 to 2005 is approximately 42.78%."

However, it also has 1939734 shares of common stock that were issued to employees, and 371441 shares of common stock that were issued to employees in previous years.\n\nNext, we need to understand the meaning of these shares. The common stock was issued to employees in exchange for three-year promissory notes ( 64001 shares ) and eleven-year promissory notes ( 289581 shares ). These shares were then used to repay a loan of approximately $ 1042 made to the company's chief executive officer in 2001.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of shares awarded to employees in 2001. Since the company had 1939734 shares of common stock in 2001, and this was used to repay a loan of $ 1042, we can set up the following equation:\n\n1939734 shares = $ 1042\n\nTo solve for the total number of shares awarded to employees in 2001, we can divide both sides of the equation by $ 1042:\n\n1939734 shares / $ 1042 = 1 share\n\nTherefore, the"

The text provides information on how these expenses are influenced by various factors, such as compensation, headcount, and business activity.\n\nNext, we need to find the growth rate in operating expenses for 2013. To do this, we compare the operating expenses in 2013 ($ 11,049 million) with the operating expenses in 2012 ($ 11,842 million).\n\nDividing the growth rate by the operating expenses in 2012, we get the growth rate. The formula for this is:\n\nGrowth rate = (Operating expenses in 2013 - Operating expenses in 2012) / Operating expenses in 2012\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get:\n\nGrowth rate = ($ 11,049 million - $ 11,842 million) / $ 11,842 million\nGrowth rate = -$ 843 million / $ 11,842 million\nGrowth rate = -0.0563\n\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease in operating expenses from 2012 to 2013.\n\nTherefore, the growth rate in operating expenses in 2013 was -5."

In 2010, the reinsurance account amount was not given, but we know that it increased by $ 138 from 2009. \n\nSo, in 2010, the reinsurance account amount was $ 39 + $ 138 = $ 177.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the percentage change in the reinsurance account amount from 2009 to 2010. \n\nThe formula for percentage change is: (new amount - old amount) / old amount * 100%.\n\nSo, the percentage change in the reinsurance account amount from 2009 to 2010 was: ($ 177 - $ 39) / $ 39 * 100% = $ 138 / $ 39 * 100% = 3.35 * 100% = 335%.\n\nTherefore, the reinsurance account amount increased by 335% from 2009 to 2010."

We can do this by subtracting the foreign currency translation adjustment from 2014 fair value.\n\nThe foreign currency translation adjustment is -4934 ( 4934 ) million.\n\nSo, the fair value of 2014 contingent consideration without the foreign currency translation adjustment will be 5743 - 4934 = 919 million.\n\nAnswer: The fair value of 2014 contingent consideration without the foreign currency translation adjustment would be 919 million."

Oppenheimer currently has 149768 shares, as given in the table. We also know that he will receive additional shares from his RSUs vesting.\n\nThe number of shares mr. Oppenheimer will receive from his vesting is not directly given in the table. However, we know that the total number of shares he would have after vesting is 2000 shares.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation to solve for the number of shares mr. Oppenheimer will receive from his vesting:\n\n149768 + x = 2000\n\nwhere x is the number of shares mr. Oppenheimer will receive from his vesting.\n\nTo solve for x, we simply subtract 149768 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 2000 - 149768\n\nx = 3332\n\nSo mr.
