According to the text, there was an unfavorable impact of $ 9.0 million. However, it's mentioned that this impact included both revenue and operating income.\n            3. Let's first find out how much of this impact was due to operating expenses. From the text, we learn that the international operations' revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, limiting the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions.\n            4. Therefore, the unfavorable impact on operating expenses due to the stronger U.S. dollar must be coming from the U.S. operations.\n            5. We can find this information in the table.

Examine the text and table: the text mentions that trading assets and liabilities are primarily securities sold, not yet purchased. This implies that the difference between trading assets and trading liabilities should give us the equity. However, the table labels trading assets and liabilities differently - while trading assets are listed as \"debt and equity instruments\" and \"derivative receivables,\" trading liabilities are listed as \"debt and equityinstruments (a)\" and \"derivative payables.\" We need to account for the difference in labeling to find the correct equity value.\n\n            3.
